# nanobots

Collection of single-purpose Telegram bots that can be helpful in a wide range of tasks. Feel free to copy-paste them and repurpose them for your needs.

I made them because usually my automation scenario looks like this:

1. I get an amazing automation idea.
2. I remember the horrors of visual programming in n8n and the labor of managing self-hosted stuff on Hetzner.
3. I remember a joke about «real Linux users who can, in 2 hours, automate a task to be completed in 5 minutes, instead of completing it in 1 hour by hand.»
4. I decide not to procrastinate on that.

But what if I already had all the needed code on hand and was able to run it somewhere without payment/administration fees? So I made it.

## Bots

- [ ] RSS notification — get notified each time an RSS feed is updated.
- [x] [Scheduled notification](https://github.com/brachkow/nanobots/tree/main/bots/scheduled-message) — get notifications based on cron jobs.
  - Build a Google Sheet habit tracker by sending yourself a Google Form every day before sleep.
- [ ] Webhook notification — get notifications on webhook requests.
- [ ] HTML notification
  - Get notified when a Shopify store opens.
- [x] [GPT transformer](https://github.com/brachkow/nanobots/tree/main/bots/gpt-transformer) — transforms your text message with OpenAI API using a predefined prompt. For example, you can:
  - Fix spelling without changing writing style.
  - Rewrite the coldest Slavic email into the most best regarding English email.

## How to host a bot

1. You need to have an account on Cloudflare.
2. Then you will be able to run `pnpm run deploy` inside the bot folder.
3. Then go to Cloudflare dashboard → Workers and Pages → {your worker} → settings → variables and secrets and add needed secrets. For all bots, you will need `BOT_TOKEN` obtainable from [@botfather](https://t.me/BotFather). Depending on the bot, you may need to add other keys — you can check which key names you need by visiting the `index.ts` of your bot and inspecting the `Env` type interface.
4. Then you need to [set a webhook for your bot](https://grammy.dev/hosting/cloudflare-workers-nodejs#setting-your-webhook) — enter this URL into your browser `https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=https://<YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_WORKER_URL>/`

That's all. Next time you can just push updates via `pnpm run deploy`. If something doesn't work, you can read [this huge guide on hosting Telegram bots on Cloudflare Workers](https://grammy.dev/hosting/cloudflare-workers-nodejs#setting-your-webhook).

## What is CHAT_ID?

Sending messages from bot to user without user intent may be tricky. To simplify this, a combination of bot + chat is used.

So, if you see the `CHAT_ID` variable in your `Env` interface, you need to:

- Create an empty chat for notifications (you can use one chat for all your bots).
- Copy the bot handle to add the bot as a chat admin.
- Send the chat URL to [@username_to_id_bot](https://t.me/username_to_id_bot) to receive CHAT_ID.
- Add it as the `CHAT_ID` variable in the Cloudflare dashboard.
